# Counting Dots

## Idea
Simply make an app that generates a random number of elements between 1 and 100.

## Concepts learned while coding
If I'm creating a bunch of the same element I need to make sure that I have the cloneNode attribute set to true on the element I'm duplicating.

I need to remember the () after using Math.random

Some ideas I had for improving this:
1. Stylize the text - I really enjoyed how the Math Quiz text came out, I might borrow that here.
2. Multicolor dots - This isn't too complex of an idea and there's a couple of ways to implement it...
    >I could just have a random color assigned to all of the dots [easiest]
    >I can have a specific number of colors that are randomly assigned to each dot [easy~moderate]
    >I could create a game out of this which leads to the next idea...[moderate]
3. Make this a counting game, I could have the dots assign a random amount of the dots to be a specific color and ask the user to confirm how many dots are that specific color.  I would have to take out some of the randomness in the color selection as having two nearly identical colors would lead to a source of frustration on the user, also if I were to make this a public app I'd have to take into account color blindness.  Not entirely sure how I'd want to go about that.


Overall, not too invested in this idea.  If the girls show interest in it I'll add to it to keep it entertaining but I did what I set out to do.  Make a functional app in an afternoon.
