                    <p id="bio">Hello, my name is Riley Robinson.  I am a developer who is continuing my journey into programming.  One aspect that has lead me to this journey is boxing.  
                        Growing up I always admired fighters and their ability to take in information and adjust to their opponent on the fly.
                        You cannot be successful if you can't learn. And one thing that my attempts at boxing have taught me, is that learning takes time.  Even the amazing on the fly adjustments, are learned weeks to months prior to the actual fight.
                        Another aspect that plays into my coding is my love of games.  It's not just sports, but videogames as well that inspire me.  It's fun to breakdown the inner workings of a game,
                        understanding the rules, making adjustments for a more interesting experience, all of this I can also get from coding.</p>

                    <div class="update" id="current">2/7/23 - So I usually dread doing responsive adjustments for screen size, but this one formed pretty well.  I've also decided to use this card as a contact page as well.
                        Should be pretty easy to do, I'll list my email and linked in to it as well as an image or gif of Gudetama. *Post doing that stuff* Still cannot get the hover feature I want to work on the Development project links.
                        Anyway, I added the contact page and adjusted the cards a little bit.  Not much else to report atm.
                    </div><br>
                    <div class ="update" id="past">2/1/23 - Finally dug in and made an honest attempt at styling my Portfolio.  
                        It's hard to admit (and this could just be due to my inexperience with CSS), but I may consider being a full Stack Developer
                        instead of just a Front End Developer, I enjoy making the functionality of the sites and projects work.  I do enjoy getting the styling right
                         and think I am getting a lot better at it (having this portfolio switch views has done alot) but it makes me excited to get back to the javascript.
                        I'll be attempting to use React or Svelt after I've increased my understanding of the fundamentals I've learned so far.
                    </div><br>
                    <div class="update" id="past2">1/25/23 - So made quite a bit of progress, still need to finish the functionality of the aboutMe and Projects pages (aboutMe will be easy just a couple of things to include video links and embed them in the sideDisplay when clicked)
                        I'm having second thoughts about the update card, I think I want to make it an actual field where users can read my updates, but I can personally write and update the page from the same page.  
                        This may require some backend work that while I don't know the details yet, I'll do some digging, but in regards to this portfolio I think I will just occassionally provide manually updated html updates until 
                        I can figure out the backend.
                    </div><br>
                    <div class="update" id="past3">1/16/23 - Okay got frustrated trying to get the cards to have their own dropdowns with just CSS, but it may be do to how I'm implementing the hover effect.
                        If need be, I'll fall back to JS for the menus to appear as needed.  I've decided to have the update card show the dates of the 3 most recent updates to the portfolio and when 
                        clicked on it will update the aboutMe section with a list of update dates and when clicked on the full update (like this one) will be displayed on the display.</div>
