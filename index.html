            <div id="aboutMe">This section is about me, it will have 3 interesting facts to expand upon. Such as <ol><li>Boxing</li><li>Gaming</li><li>& Learning</li></ol>
            <p>Hello, my name is Riley Robinson.  I am a developer who is continuing my journey into programming.  One aspect that has lead me to this journey is boxing.  
                Growing up I always admired fighters and their ability to take in information and adjust to their opponent on the fly.</p>
                <p>You cannot be successful if you can't learn. And one thing that my attempts at boxing have taught me, is that learning takes time.  Even the amazing on the fly adjustments, are learned weeks to months prior to the actual fight.
                Another aspect that plays into my coding is my love of games.  It's not just sports, but videogames as well that inspire me.  It's fun to breakdown the inner workings of a game,
                understanding the rules, making adjustments for a more interesting experience, all of this I can also get from coding.</p></div>

            <div class="card" id="updates">Updates
                <div class="update" id="current">1/16/22 - Okay got frustrated trying to get the cards to have their own dropdowns with just CSS, but it may be do to how I'm implementing the hover effect.
                    If need be, I'll fall back to JS for the menus to appear as needed.  I've decided to have the update card show the dates of the 3 most recent updates to the portfolio and when 
                    clicked on it will update the aboutMe section with a list of update dates and when clicked on the full update (like this one) will be displayed on the display.

        <p>This is just a placeholder for now, will add contact and resume links here. Need to keep in mind that there needs to be a separate contact page.</p>
        <p>Can list skills but, should use logos of skills instead of just listing them</p>
