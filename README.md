# 3rd attempt at a Portfolio

This is my first mark down file and my 3rd attempt at making a somewhat good looking portfolio.  I am taking my front-end development course through CodeCademy.  Below I'm outlining what I'm aiming for.

## Design in 3's

Mabey this is just a goofy goal, but since this is officially my 3rd portfolio, I want to theme things around the number 3.  So there will be 3 main sections of the index, the profile picture, the about me section and the gallery section.

I want the about me section and profile picture to be on the same row, but the gallery to be bellow them sectioned into 3 clickable icons.

## Features

I want to have 3 facts about me but if they are highlighted I want something to happen to the profile picture (I haven't decided what should occur, color change would be simple but a shift to a different picture might be fun).  I also want a visual queue on the gallery icons.

The gallery will be split into 3: Art work, Projects, Updates.  I want the icon for each to have a visual prompt when highlighted, I'm going with a card effect for a quick snappy visual eye catcher.

### Art Work

When clicked on, I want the images displayed in a horizontal scroll.

### Projects

I'm going to limit this to 3 projects I have worked on and are at least somewhat functional.
So I'll be including the ABC Flashcard project/ The Code Cademy Dasmoto's project/ and a yet to be determined 3rd.  (I'm between two I guess)
When clicked on, I want 3 cards displaying the project names to appear
#### Update on this one
I will do a math quiz project, the app will allow you to choose a math function (addition, subtraction, ect) and randomly generate 5 problems and provide results after all questions have been answered. Will require HTML, CSS, and JS
#### Complaint update
I'm far too unfamiliar with CSS, been struggling to get basic design down, at least it's a part I'm addressing now.  Considering using something like tailwind in the future but for now will stick with vanilla CSS as I believe that's what is intended by the CodeCademy course.  Will have to implement JS to have the display and aboutMe sections become interactive, which shouldn't be too hard, I've already formed a vague idea on what I need to do I just need to actually do it.  Sorry for the wordy update just cyber venting.  Before I commit this, I do have an idea I'll try tomorrow, I'm wondering if my HTML structure is causing an issue with the hover effect I'm going for since the menu is currently nested within the same card div I may need the menu outside of that div to work correctly. - Update, nope just didn't work, so we'll try a completely different method.

### Updates

This should be the most simple, when clicked on I want it to show the 3 most recent updates.
I can create these updates as I work on the project.

#### Dev Updates

Using this for personal thoughts towards this Portfolio of mine.  I have had a lot of fun updating this over the past few weeks, mostly thanks to Sabrina who has agreed to tutor me a bit.  I have added an animation to my art gallery (it does not activate every time by design) and have realized that some projects just evolve, on their own.
I started making the alphabet Quiz for the twins, which made me think of the Math Quiz project for my younger brother, which then turned to the counting dots project which has now evolved to the counting quiz project.  
It's truely amazing how these ideas can just lead into completely new ideas and understanding.  I need to take my learning more seriously so I can do this professionally, but I'm pretty proud that I was able to do what I can due to my resources (Codecademy and Fireship.io)

#### Ideas updates
Have been getting more coding done, I just wanted to make a checklist of things I wanna do in case I forget due to the many moving parts of life:
1. Fix the Math Quiz program to only allow numerical entries
2. Python based recipe cookbook
3. Actually finish the Portal parody website
4. Redesign the base Portfolio page, and choose a better color scheme.
5. Better CSS spacing for my previous projects
6. Need to have the JS files reset when the page is refreshed
