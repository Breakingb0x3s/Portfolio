# 3rd attempt at a Portfolio

This is my first mark down file and my 3rd attempt at making a somewhat good looking portfolio.  I am taking my front-end development course through CodeCademy.  Below I'm outlining what I'm aiming for.

## Design in 3's

Mabey this is just a goofy goal, but since this is officially my 3rd portfolio, I want to theme things around the number 3.  So there will be 3 main sections of the index, the profile picture, the about me section and the gallery section.

I want the about me section and profile picture to be on the same row, but the gallery to be bellow them sectioned into 3 clickable icons.

## Features

I want to have 3 facts about me but if they are highlighted I want something to happen to the profile picture (I haven't decided what should occur, color change would be simple but a shift to a different picture might be fun).  I also want a visual queue on the gallery icons.

The gallery will be split into 3: Art work, Projects, Updates.  I want the icon for each to have a visual prompt when highlighted, I'm going with a card effect for a quick snappy visual eye catcher.

### Art Work

When clicked on, I want the images displayed in a horizontal scroll.

### Projects

I'm going to limit this to 3 projects I have worked on and are at least somewhat functional.
So I'll be including the ABC Flashcard project/ The Code Cademy Dasmoto's project/ and a yet to be determined 3rd.  (I'm between two I guess)
When clicked on, I want 3 cards displaying the project names to appear
#### Update on this one
I will do a math quiz project, the app will allow you to choose a math function (addition, subtraction, ect) and randomly generate 5 problems and provide results after all questions have been answered. Will require HTML, CSS, and JS
#### Complaint update
I'm far to unfamiliar with CSS, been struggling to get basic design down, at least it's a part I'm addressing now.  Considering using something like tailwind in the future but for now will stick with vanilla CSS as I believe that's what is intended by the CodeCademy course.  Will have to implement JS to have the display and aboutMe sections become interactive, which shouldn't be too hard, I've already formed a vague idea on what I need to do I just need to actually do it.  Sorry for the wordy update just cyber venting.  Before I commit this, I do have an idea I'll try tomorrow, I'm wondering if my HTML structure is causing an issue with the hover effect I'm going for since the menu is currently nested within the same card div I may need the menu outside of that div to work correctly. - Update, nope just didn't work, so we'll try a completely different method.

### Updates

This should be the most simple, when clicked on I want it to show the 3 most recent updates.
I can create these updates as I work on the project.
