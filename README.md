# 3rd attempt at a Portfolio

This is my first mark down file and my 3rd attempt at making a somewhat good looking portfolio.  I am taking my front-end development course through CodeCademy.  Below I'm outlining what I'm aiming for.

## Design in 3's

Mabey this is just a goofy goal, but since this is officially my 3rd portfolio, I want to theme things around the number 3.  So there will be 3 main sections of the index, the profile picture, the about me section and the gallery section.

I want the about me section and profile picture to be on the same row, but the gallery to be bellow them sectioned into 3 clickable icons.

## Features

I want to have 3 facts about me but if they are highlighted I want something to happen to the profile picture (I haven't decided what should occur, color change would be simple but a shift to a different picture might be fun).  I also want a visual queue on the gallery icons.

The gallery will be split into 3: Art work, Projects, Updates.  I want the icon for each to have a visual prompt when highlighted, I'm going with a card effect for a quick snappy visual eye catcher.

### Art Work

When clicked on, I want the images displayed in a horizontal scroll.

### Projects

I'm going to limit this to 3 projects I have worked on and are at least somewhat functional.
So I'll be including the ABC Flashcard project/ The Code Cademy Dasmoto's project/ and a yet to be determined 3rd.  (I'm between two I guess)
When clicked on, I want 3 cards displaying the project names to appear
#### Update on this one
I will do a math quiz project, the app will allow you to choose a math function (addition, subtraction, ect) and randomly generate 5 problems and provide results after all questions have been answered. Will require HTML, CSS, and JS

### Updates

This should be the most simple, when clicked on I want it to show the 3 most recent updates.
I can create these updates as I work on the project.
